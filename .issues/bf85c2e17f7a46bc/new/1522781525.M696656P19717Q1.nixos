Subject: Check for misnamed arguments
Message-Id: <bf85c2e17f7a46bc-0-artemis@nixos>

For example, if we accept an argument under one name but have to
immediately rename it:

  foo = bar: baz { quux = bar; };

In cases like this we can either rename `bar` to `quux` and use
`inherit quux` or rename the `quux` argument to `bar` and use
`inherit bar`
