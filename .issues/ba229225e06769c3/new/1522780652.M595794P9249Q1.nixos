Subject: Check for complicated splice escaping
Message-Id: <ba229225e06769c3-0-artemis@nixos>

For example, if we're writing a bash script and we want to use "${foo}"
then this will conflict with Nix's own syntax. There are ways to work
around this with escaping, but it can be easier to just concatenate the
string from pieces, e.g. "${"$" + "{foo}"}"
