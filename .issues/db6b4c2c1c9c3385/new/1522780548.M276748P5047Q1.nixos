Subject: Add checks for potentially-dodgy quoting
Message-Id: <db6b4c2c1c9c3385-0-artemis@nixos>

Nix seems to have some edge-cases when it comes to string quoting and
splices. We should investigate these (e.g. I seem to remember that it's
a bad idea to end a string with a splice?) and add checks for them.
