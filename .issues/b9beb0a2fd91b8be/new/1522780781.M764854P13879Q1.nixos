Subject: Add check for eval-time building
Message-Id: <b9beb0a2fd91b8be-0-artemis@nixos>

This should include stuff like readFile where the argument is a
derivation.

We should have separate checks for import from derivation and using
callPackage on a derivation, since those are the preferred mechanisms
if we do turn out to want eval-time building.
